## 🎯 **DEPLOYMENT PHASES**

### **🔧 Phase 1: Validation Testing**
```bash
# 1. Test system structure
python3 test_simple_validation.py

# 2. Test full functionality (requires dependencies)
python3 test_institutional_master.py

# 3. Test individual components
python3 test_cisd.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All structural tests pass

- ⚡ Signal validation and conflict resolution
- 🛡️ Risk management decisions
- 🧠 Learning loop updates

### **⚡ Phase 3: Live Trading (When Ready)**
```bash
# 1. Change execution driver to "mt5" in config.json
# 2. Verify broker connection
# 3. Start with minimal risk
python3 main.py
```

**Critical Monitoring:**
- 📊 Real-time performance metrics
- 🚨 Alert system functionality
- 💰 PnL tracking and drawdown monitoring
- 🔄 System health and adaptation

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**❌ Issue**: Import errors for new engines
**✅ Solution**: 
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy
```

**❌ Issue**: "No module named 'core.institutional_trading_master'"
**✅ Solution**: 
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project root directory
cd /workspace
python3 main.py
```

**❌ Issue**: Configuration validation fails
**✅ Solution**: 
- Check `config.json` syntax (valid JSON)
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Verify symbol names are correct

**❌ Issue**: MT5 connection fails
**✅ Solution**: 
- Check MT5 credentials in config
- Ensure MT5 terminal is running
- Try paper connector first

**❌ Issue**: Low system health score
**✅ Solution**: 
- Check individual engine health
- Review recent error logs
- Restart system if needed

### **Emergency Procedures**

**🚨 If System Becomes Unresponsive:**
1. Force stop: Ctrl+C
2. Check logs for errors
3. Restart with paper connector
4. Contact support if persistent

**🚨 If Unexpected Losses:**
1. Immediately halt trading
2. Review recent trade narratives
3. Check risk management logs
4. Analyze system health metrics
